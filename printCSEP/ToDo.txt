TODO:
Review why we don't find a STEP tag in the XML allResult output files. This is leading to duplication entries for each day, both ETAS results. We can stop the STEP result parser from finding the ETAS result, if that is the correct process.

Update the TestResult print method to give a full object report, including path names. Add a report that includes the full object report.

add the model_names, and test_names to the standard header

Figure out whay aug 1 to aug 5 does not include aug 5 in the processing.

Document example results:
2007-08-01 - ntest_format_1 results
2010-03-01 - last format 1 result
2010-07-05 - missing results file
2010-11-22 - example of format 2 results (with ETAS onlye)
2012-05-28 - no result file found
2016-01-20 - missing step results in format 2
2017-03-03 - missing step results in format 2
